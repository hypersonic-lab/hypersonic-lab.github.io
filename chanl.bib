With v1.0.0, users can compute thermodynamic and transport properties, multiphase linearly-constrained equilibria, chemical production rates, energy transfer rates, and gas-surface interactions. The framework is based on an object-oriented design in C++, allowing users to plug-and-play various models, algorithms, and data as necessary.

	Abstract = {This paper presents the prediction of equilibrium thermodynamic properties of liquid cesium metal and transport properties of cesium metal vapor by applying an identical potential function obtained from liquid cohesive energy density data including data for the supercooled state at proximity of absolute zero. Prediction of equilibrium thermodynamic properties is made possible by derivation of isotherms, which is accurately linear in the whole liquid range including metal--nonmetal transition. For transport properties, the collision integrals are tabulated, and values of viscosity plus thermal conductivity of cesium vapor are obtained from Chapman--Enskog solutions of Boltzman equation. The viscosity values are in agreement with experiment within $\pm$4% with average deviation 2%, and are in agreement with theory within $\pm$4.70% with average deviation 3.26%. The thermal conductivity values are in agreement with experiment within 11% with average deviation 8%, and are in agreement with theory within 4.2% with average deviation 2.8% over the temperature range considered. It is likely that the potential function can be used to predict both equilibrium and transport properties with reasonably good accuracies.},

	Abstract = {Ionic Kratzer-type potentials (such as the Varshni V-potential) are shown to be consistent with all observed lower- and higher-order spectroscopic constants αe, ωeχe, βe and γe for over thirty diatomics of widely differing ionic characters. All higher Dunham coefficients can be derived from the first, which is itself related to the force constant. The ionic potentials are compared with other potentials discussed in the literature (Dunham, Morse, Simons---Parr−Finlan, Jordan). The deviations of Morse curves near re from RKR-curves are completely predictable using an ionic potential as reference. The Calder-Ruedenberg constant, applicable to 160 diatomics, is consistently accounted for. Calculated vibrational levels for Li2 on both sides of the minimum correspond with experimental levels within 0.6%, whereas computed ΔG(υ)-values are accurate to within 1%. For the excited state, A 1Σu+ of Li2 the same potential is also satisfactory. An ionic potential corrected for an atomic dissociation limit at r = ∞ produces a finite solution at r ≈ 0. In the case of Li2 the energy at r ≈ 10−4 {\AA} is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental fusion energy of two Li-nuclei into a single C-nucleus.},

It is shown that it is preferable to consider the coefficients of the vibration-rotation interaction function [Fv′v(m)]12 rather than the Herman-Wallis factors. Two formalisms derived from power series expansion of the vibration-rotational internuclear potential function have been applied to the infrared transitions v→v′ (with v = 0, 10, 20) of the ground electronic state of CO.},
